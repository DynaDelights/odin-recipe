    <p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3></p>
    <p>
        <Ul>
        <li>1/2 (14.1-ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts, at room temperature (such as Pillsbury)</li>
        <li>7 large egg whites, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>whipped cream for serving</li>
        <li>sliced bananas for serving</li>
        </Ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate; fold edges over, and crimp with the tines of a fork. Poke holes evenly along the sides and bottom of pie crust with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until pie crust is dry to the touch on the bottom and sides, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gently fold together egg whites, flaked coconut, graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until fully combined and a thick mixture forms, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Transfer egg white mixture to prepared pie crust and gently spread it into an even layer.</li>
    <li>Return to the oven and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until pie crust edges are golden brown and the center is set, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Slice and top with whipped cream and sliced bananas.</li>
    </ol>
